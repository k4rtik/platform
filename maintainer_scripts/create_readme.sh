# Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} providing ${COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_TITLE}

The [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr) provides a formal language
to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms, and theorems, together
with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

The [Coq Platform](https://github.com/coq/platform) is a distribution of the Coq
interactive prover together with a selection of Coq libraries and plugins.

The Coq Platform supports to install several versions of Coq (also in parallel).
This README file is for **Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} with Coq ${COQ_PLATFORM_COQ_TAG}**.
The README files for other versions are linked in the main [README](../README.md).

${COQ_PLATFORM_VERSION_DESCRIPTION}

The Coq Platform supports four levels of installation extent:
**base**, **IDE**, **full** and **extended** and a few **optional** packages.
The sections below provide a short description of each level and the list of
packages included in each level. Packaged versions of the Coq Platform usually
contain the **extended** set with all optional packages.

**Note on non-free licenses:** The Coq Platform contains software with
**non-free licenses which do not allow commercial use without purchasing a license**,
notably the **coq-compcert** package. Please study the package licenses given
below and verify that they are compatible with your intended use in case you
plan to use these packages.

**Note on license information:**
The license information given below is obtained from opam.
The Coq Platform team does no double check this information.

**Note on multiple licenses:** 
In case several licenses are given below, it is not clearly specified what this means.
It could mean that parts of the software use one license while other parts use another license.
It could also mean that you can choose between the given licenses.
Please clarify the details with the homepage of the package.

**Note:** The package list is also available as [CSV](${RESULT_FILE_CSV#${DOC_PATH}/}).

**Note:** Click on the triangle to show additional information for a package!

## **Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} with Coq ${COQ_PLATFORM_COQ_TAG} "base level"**

The **base level** is mostly intended as a basis for custom installations using
opam and contains the following package(s):

EOT

for package in ${PACKAGES_BASE}; do
	html_package_opam "${package}" base
done

cat >>${RESULT_FILE_MD} <<EOT
<br>

## **Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} with Coq ${COQ_PLATFORM_COQ_TAG} "IDE level"**

The **IDE level** adds an interactive development environment to the **base level**.

For beginners, e.g. following introductory tutorials, this level is usually sufficient.
If you install the **IDE level**, you can later add additional packages individually
via \`opam install <package-name>\` or rerun the Coq Platform installation script
and choose the full or extended level.

The **IDE level** contains the following package(s):

EOT

for package in ${PACKAGES_IDE}; do
	html_package_opam "${package}" ide
done

cat >>${RESULT_FILE_MD} <<EOT
<br>

## **Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} with Coq ${COQ_PLATFORM_COQ_TAG} "full level"**

The **full level** adds many commonly used coq libraries, plug-ins and
developments.

The packages in the **full level** are mature, well maintained
and suitable as basis for your own developments.
See the Coq Platform [charter](charter.md) for details.

The **full level** contains the following packages:

EOT

for package in ${PACKAGES_FULL}; do
	html_package_opam "${package}" full
done

cat >>${RESULT_FILE_MD} <<EOT
<br>

## **Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} with Coq ${COQ_PLATFORM_COQ_TAG} "optional packages"**

The **optional** packages have the same maturity and maintenance level as the
packages in the full level, but either have a **non open source license** or
depend on packages with non open source license.

The interactive installation script and the Windows installer explicitly ask
if you want to install these packages.

The macOS and snap installation bundles always include these packages.

The following packages are **optional**:

EOT

for package in ${PACKAGES_OPTIONAL}; do
	html_package_opam "${package}" optional
done

cat >>${RESULT_FILE_MD} <<EOT
<br>

## **Coq Platform ${COQ_PLATFORM_RELEASE} with Coq ${COQ_PLATFORM_COQ_TAG} "extended level"**

The **extended level** contains packages which are in a beta stage or otherwise
don't yet have the level of maturity or support required for inclusion in the
full level, but there are plans to move them to the full level in a future
release of Coq Platform. The main point of the extended level is advertisement:
users are important to bring a development from a beta to a release state.

The interactive installation script explicitly asks if you want to install these packages.
The macOS and snap installation bundles always include these packages.
The Windows installer also includes them, and they are selected by default.

The **extended level** contains the following packages:

EOT

for package in ${PACKAGES_EXTENDED}; do
	html_package_opam "${package}" extended
done

cat >>${RESULT_FILE_MD} <<EOT
<br>

## **Dependency packages**

In addition the dependencies listed below are partially or fully included or required during build time.
Please note, that the version numbers given are the versions of opam packages,
which do not always match with the version of the supplied packages.
E.g. some opam packages just refer to latest packages e.g. installed by MacPorts,
Homebrew or Linux system package managers.
Please refer to the linked opam package and/or your system package manager for details on what software version is used.

EOT

# sort packages by name, but ignore a "conf-" prefix
for package in ${PACKAGES_ALL}; do
	html_package_opam "${package}" dependency
done
